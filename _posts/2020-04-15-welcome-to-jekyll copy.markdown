I am currently learning about machine learning and idea of this post is to give a clear description of how to achieve a multivarite linear regression using MATLAB or Python. 

I hope to provide some intuition in what follows and a working example so that it is possible to see how the maths works. 

What is a multivariate linear regerssion and why do we need it? 


What is gradient descent and how is it useful for performing a linear regression? 


What is the normal equation?
